I'm Sidney, but they call me Squid. I've got experience in blah, blah, blah.
You're here cuz you need help, insights, or would like to reach me. I'm a full
stack business man. I love thinking about how to organize teams, apply best
practices, and deliver useful technology. I'm always learning and
experimenting. These days it's with Rust, Go, and JAM stack apps

They call me squid
I'm either meditating or coding to Drake right now
Everything with intention
Learning every day
Open minded
Full stack dev with a focus on innovation
Write the tests first
Devops for the win
Leverage to accelerate. Duplicated efforts just ignore the ecosystem
My free time is spent traveling, editing my vimrc, and swooning over Drake
Sarcastic as hell, I'm sorry
Laughing so we don't cry
Clear concise communication.
I love pushing go
Sometimes funny often too real

I'm Sidney, but they call me Squid. I'm a web consultant with a background in
full stack web development and digital marketing. Let me guess. You want to get
up and running quickly on the web. Well, web programming is how I wandered into
technology and I've been building on the web ever since. These days I'm working
with kubernetes, go, and JAM stack apps - sorry to get buzz wordy. Here's what
I help my clients with:
- Creating responsive web pages that load fast, look good on all devices, and
  keep viewers engaged (page load speed and mobile are really important for any
	modern web page)
- Integrating best practices to leave clients with code bases/products that are built to last
- Clear concise communication
- Fullstack web development. This means hosting solutions, backend tech,
  databases, cloud providers, etc. If this doesn't mean anything to you
	don't worry about it - I've got you covered if need be

Well what does that look like? My work concretely takes the following forms:
- Landing pages
- Blogs
- Cloud Architecture
- SEO
- Advertising
- Copywriting

If it sounds like we're a good fit drop me a line. I'm probably meditating, or
coding to Drake right now but I'll be with you shortly.

If you're still not convinced maybe check out my blog and see how I think
